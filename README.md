# Selling_price-Car_Dekho
In this project, the dataset contains information about used cars listed on www.cardekho.com. This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.

## <b><u> Few things to keep in mind :</u>
* ### You should take care of categorical variables (variables which take discrete categories or classes) and do one-hot encoding to be able to pass them into the model.
* ### Try to include as many plots and charts you can. This adds for a great visual interpretation of your tasks/activities.
* ### Write detailed explanation of your approaches in the notebook and once you have some results, try to provide explanations for these observed results. Remember our objective is not only to build a machine learning model but to be able to explain why, what and how of the entire modeling process.
